WARNING: `float` is imprecise, and shortly I will be moving everything over to bignum. Large numbers will come out incorrect! (ex. 170 factorial)

gecho is somewhat similar to FORTH. It will probably become less so as it grows.

# Install

IF ON A MAC

1. compile with `sudo make do-all CC=<compiler of choice> INAME=<what you want gecho to be called> CNAME=<what you want gechoc to be called>`
    * CC defaults to `cc` and INAME/CNAME default to `gecho` and `gechoc`, respectively

OR

1. `sudo make CC=<compiler of choice>`
    * Just compiles.

Three Options...

FIRST

1. `make CC=<compiler of choice>`
    * You can use whatever C compiler you want, defaults to `cc`
2. `sudo make install`.
    * Moves it to `/usr/bin/`.

SECOND

`sudo make go CC=<compiler of choice>`
    * Just makes and cleans up and moves it to `/usr/bin/` for you. Compiler defaults to `cc`.

THIRD

`sudo make do-all CC=<compiler of choice>`
    * Compiles and installs both interpreter and compiler. Compiler defaults to `cc`.

# Stack Theory

Think of a stack of books. It starts off empty.

`[ ]`

However, when you put (or `push`) a book (number) onto the stack, it gets added to the top.

`[ 12 ]`

Keep adding numbers, and it will soon look like this.

`[ 12, 4, 8, 3 ]`

Note that `3` is at the top of the stack, and `12` is at the bottom.

One can also take off (or `pop`) elements from the stack.

`[ 12, 4, 8 ]`

`> 3.00`

The number gets returned as a result of popping it.

Operands can pop numbers from the stack and interact with them. For example,

`.. 1 2 +`

would clear the stack, push `1`, then push `2`, then pop them both and add them. It will then push the result onto the stack. The stack now looks like this:

`[ 3 ]`

That's stack theory.

# The Interpreter

####If on a Mac, just replace `gecho` with `gecho-mac` and `gechoc` with `gechoc-mac`

1. SHELL
    * just run `gecho` (or `./gecho`)

2. FILE READ
    * run `gecho <filename>` (or `./gecho <filename>`)
    * MUST have `END` at end of file!

3. FILE READ THEN SHELL
    * run `gecho <filename> --shell` (or `./gecho <filename> --shell`)
    * MUST have `END` at end of file!

4. COMPILE GECHO
    * run `gechoc <filename>`
    * run `<compiler of choice> <filename> -o <filename> -lm`
    * run `<filename>`

#### Whitespace does not matter!

# Modes

3. `tracker`
    * After being enabled, counts the commands entered. Can be viewed with `tot`.
